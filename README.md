# x86 Assembly (MASM)
x86 Assembly Demo Programs as follows:

Project_01.asm -> Arithmetic operations and FPU division.

Project_02.asm -> Fibonacci Sequence Number Generator to 46 inclusive.

Project_03.asm -> Integer Accumulator with negative integers.

Project_04.asm -> Composite number generator from 1 to 1,000,000.

Project_05.asm -> Displays user requested number of random ints in a range, displays the median, then sorts descending.

Project_06.asm -> Displays 10 validated ints, their sum and average, but the hard way, storing type int as string and converting back to type integer using Macros.
